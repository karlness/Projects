# Four-Legged Walker Project
# Team Members: Karl Carisme, Noah Taniguchi, Michael Waetzman
# Course: ENG EC444, Spring 2024
# Adapted from: Espressif example project code and course code.

# Overview
This project involves the creation of a four-legged walker robot controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller. The walker uses I2C communication for a 14-segment alphanumeric display and PWM signals to control servos responsible for leg movement. This system is designed to incrementally move the walker forward while updating the display in real-time to show elapsed time or other status indicators.

The walker uses FreeRTOS tasks for handling the display updates and the control of two servos that generate walking motion. The design allows for continuous movement until certain conditions are met (e.g., time expiration or manual stop), after which the walker will pause.

# Key Features:
I2C Communication: Interfaces with a 14-segment display to provide visual feedback during operation.
Servo Control: Two servos control the forward motion of the walker, with predefined angles to simulate leg movement.
Real-time Clock Functionality: Updates time displayed on the alphanumeric display in real-time.
FreeRTOS: Uses real-time tasks for multitasking between servo control and display updates.
Modular Design: Provides flexibility for future improvements, such as integrating additional sensors or controls.



# Hardware Used:
ESP32 Microcontroller: Controls servos and handles I2C communication.
Servos: Two servos are used to drive the four-legged walker by altering angles between -45° and +45°.
14-segment alphanumeric display: Used to display time and other relevant information via I2C.


# Functional Breakdown:
# Servo Control:

Two servos are attached to GPIO pins of the ESP32 and are responsible for walking motion.
Motion is generated by incrementing the servo angle in small steps, alternating between forward and backward movements to simulate walking.
A step counter tracks the number of walking cycles completed.


# I2C Communication for 14-Segment Display:

The 14-segment display is initialized using I2C communication to show the elapsed time in the format MM:SS.
The display updates at regular intervals and handles timing down to zero, after which it resets.


# Multitasking with FreeRTOS:


The project utilizes FreeRTOS to split functionality between the servo control tasks and display updates.
Separate tasks handle the control of each servo, while another task manages the 14-segment display.



# Future Improvements:
Implementing button control to reset or pause the walk cycle.
Reducing reliance on global variables and improving function documentation with Javadoc comments.
Adding more complex walking patterns and additional sensors for environment interaction.
How to Run:
Install the necessary ESP32 and I2C libraries in your environment.
Connect the ESP32 to the servo motors and 14-segment display as per the pin configuration in the code.
Flash the code to the ESP32.
The walker will start moving, and the display will show a countdown timer.
